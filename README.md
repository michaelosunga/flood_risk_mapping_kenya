# Understanding flood risk in Kenya
**An open GIS framework for flood risk mapping in Kenya**
# Introduction
Flood hazards have been highlighted as the most frequent types of disasters occurring in the world. Mostly, a flood hazard occurs when an overflow of water submerges land that is usually dry. Floods are often caused by heavy rainfall, rapid snowmelt or a storm surge from a tropical cyclone or tsunami in coastal area. In this context, mapping of flood hazard is concentrated on the use of rainfall generated flooding which mostly occurs as a result of river overflows. 

The flood hazard mapping exercise was conducted using the Quantum GIS (QGIS) framework, with openly available raster and vector data sets. The flood hazard maps, given in terms of extent and depth were obtained from Global Flood Awareness System (GLOFAS). These datasets depict flood prone areas in Europe and the World for river flood events of different magnitude (from 1-in-10-year to 1-in-500-year). The flood hazard layers have been developed using hydrological and hydrodynamic models, driven by the climatological data of the European and Global Flood Awareness Systems (EFAS and GloFAS) of the Copernicus Emergency Management Service. 
The flood hazard maps are in raster format (GEOTIF) with a grid resolution of 90m (3 arcseconds). These maps can be used to assess the exposure of population and economic assets to river floods, and to perform flood risk assessments in any flood prone county in Kenya.
