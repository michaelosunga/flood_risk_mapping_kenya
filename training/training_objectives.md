# Introduction
Garissa and Tana River counties in Kenya are frequently impacted by severe flooding, leading to loss of life, property damage, and displacement of communities. These regions are predominantly low-lying and are characterized by the expansive Tana River and its tributaries. Climate change, land-use changes, and inadequate infrastructure exacerbate the frequency and severity of floods. There is an urgent need for a comprehensive flood risk assessment of counties within the Tana River basin to enhance preparedness and mitigation efforts.

# Training objectives
To conduct a comprehensive flood risk assessment and develop detailed flood risk maps for **Garissa** and **Tana River** counties to inform disaster risk reduction and management strategies. 

## The specific objectives of the end of inception phase workshop are to: 
- To identify and map flood-prone areas in Garissa and Tana River counties.
- To assess the socio-economic vulnerabilities of communities living in flood-prone areas.
- To evaluate the existing flood management infrastructure and capacity.
- To provide actionable recommendations for enhancing flood resilience and reducing vulnerabilities.

# Expected Outputs
1. Flood Hazard Maps
>Detailed maps highlighting flood-prone areas, flood depths, and potential impact zones.
2. Vulnerability Profiles
>Comprehensive profiles of vulnerable communities and infrastructure, including schools, health centers, and water supply systems.
3. Policy Recommendations
>Strategic recommendations for flood risk reduction, including land-use planning, infrastructure improvements, and community-based disaster risk management initiatives.

The proposed vulnerability assessment and flood mapping initiative in Garissa and Tana River counties aim to enhance the resilience of communities to flood hazards. By providing detailed flood maps and vulnerability assessments, this report will equip local authorities and communities with the necessary tools and knowledge to mitigate flood risks effectively. This initiative is a critical step towards sustainable development and climate resilience in the region.

# Project Location
The project focuses on Garissa and Tana River Counties which are vulnerable to flooding and drought. 

# Training approach

This digital flood risk mapping technical manual was developed to build open GIS literacy capacity amongst key disaster risk management (DRM) departments to adequately input, manipulate, analyse, visualise and disseminate GIS data from open  data and GIS software in order to understand flood risk. 
The training module is divided into several sessions:

## Session 1
### Installing QGIS & Interface Overview
- Installing relevant QGIS plugins
- Data management / QGIS working folder
- Basic QGIS tools and functionalities
- Understanding data sources and adding layers in QGIS
- Working with raster and vector data
- Adding base maps in QGIS (Google, OSM, etc.)
- Introduction to data projections and coordinate systems


### Data Types & Sources for Flood Mapping
- Flood exposure datasets: DEM, satellite imagery, and hydrological data (flood hazard at various return periods - rtps)
- Public data sources on flood exposure: downloading DEMs, land use/land cover (LULC), OpenStreetMap (OSM), settlements / buildings, roads and relevant points of interests (schools, hospitals, market centres)

## Session 2
### Introduction to OpenStreetMap as a data crowd-sourcing tool
- Downloading vector data from OpenStreetMap (OSM)
- OSM data model
- OSM data completeness
- QuickOSM
- Updating data on OSM (Mapathons)

## Session 3
## Session 4
Visualising GIS data through maps. Use of cartography to create map products for communication and decision-making.

# How to use this technical manual? 
This digital training manual is developed for absolute GIS beginners. It is a step-by-step guide to  learning essential GIS analysis using QGIS for flood risk mapping. This manual is not a guarantee  that at its conclusion all the trainees will be proficient in geo-information since GIS is vast  with other applications. Therefore, the learner can use the knowledge acquired to further their knowledge in GIS or follow our occasional GIS training manual modules.
